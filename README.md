Hello Gentleman,

It's an editable resume created using react with the help of Sudan-s-Tech.

So, If anyone of you want to edit it then go to the config.js file in src directory to update the json as per your individual information and if anyone of you add more items in any section then you can go ahead like this:
For example you want to add more experience in your resume then copy this snippet and paste it in experience array after filling the required info....
 {
    duration:"",
    company_Name:"",
    role:"",
    role_Description:""
  }

  Thank you:-)
